    "summary": "In order to facilitate the accesses of general users to knowledge graphs, an increasing effort is being exerted to construct graph-structured queries of given natural language questions. At the core of the construction is to deduce the structure of the target query and determine the vertices/edges which constitute the query. Existing query construction methods rely on question understanding and conventional graph-based algorithms which lead to inefficient and degraded performances facing complex natural language questions over knowledge graphs with large scales. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel framework standing on recent knowledge graph embedding techniques. Our framework first encodes the underlying knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embedding space by leveraging generalized local knowledge graphs. Given a natural language question, the learned embedding representations of the knowledge graph are utilized to compute the query structure and assemble vertices/edges into the target query. Extensive experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset, and the results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models regarding effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "summary": "Many practical graph problems, such as knowledge graph construction and drug-drug interaction prediction, require to handle multi-relational graphs. However, handling real-world multi-relational graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, as new entities (nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction task but also between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion and drug-drug interaction prediction. The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "Recently, a considerable literature has grown up around the theme of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification.",

    "summary": "Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of entities and relationships, has attracted considerable research efforts recently. However, most knowledge graph embedding methods focus on the structural relationships in fixed triples while ignoring the temporal information. Currently, existing time-aware graph embedding methods only focus on the factual plausibility, while ignoring the temporal smoothness which models the interactions between a fact and its contexts, and thus can capture fine-granularity temporal relationships. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a Robustly Time-aware Graph Embedding (RTGE) method by incorporating temporal smoothness. Two major innovations of our paper are presented here. At first, RTGE integrates a measure of temporal smoothness in the learning process of the time-aware graph embedding. Via the proposed additional smoothing factor, RTGE can preserve both structural information and evolutionary patterns of a given graph. Secondly, RTGE provides a general task-oriented negative sampling strategy associated with temporally-aware information, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed algorithm and plays an essential role in obtaining superior performance in various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark tasks show that RTGE can increase performance in entity/relationship/temporal scoping prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "Representation learning methods for heterogeneous networks produce a low-dimensional vector embedding for each node that is typically fixed for all tasks involving the node. Many of the existing methods focus on obtaining a static vector representation for a node in a way that is agnostic to the downstream application where it is being used. In practice, however, downstream tasks such as link prediction require specific contextual information that can be extracted from the subgraphs related to the nodes provided as input to the task. To tackle this challenge, we develop SLiCE, a framework bridging static representation learning methods using global information from the entire graph with localized attention driven mechanisms to learn contextual node representations. We first pre-train our model in a self-supervised manner by introducing higher-order semantic associations and masking nodes, and then fine-tune our model for a specific link prediction task. Instead of training node representations by aggregating information from all semantic neighbors connected via metapaths, we automatically learn the composition of different metapaths that characterize the context for a specific task without the need for any pre-defined metapaths. SLiCE significantly outperforms both static and contextual embedding learning methods on several publicly available benchmark network datasets. We also interpret the semantic association matrix and provide its utility and relevance in making successful link predictions between heterogeneous nodes in the network.",

    "summary": "The task of inferring the missing links in a graph based on its current structure is referred to as link prediction. Link prediction methods that are based on pairwise node similarity are well-established approaches in the literature. They show good prediction performance in many real-world graphs though they are heuristics and lack of universal applicability. On the other hand, the success of neural networks for classification tasks in various domains leads researchers to study them in graphs. When a neural network can operate directly on the graph, then it is termed as the graph neural network (GNN). GNN is able to learn hidden features from graphs which can be used for link prediction task in graphs. Link predictions based on GNNs have gained much attention of researchers due to their convincing high performance in many real-world graphs. This appraisal paper studies some similarity and GNN-based link prediction approaches in the domain of homogeneous graphs that consists of a single type of (attributed) nodes and single type of pairwise links. We evaluate the studied approaches against several benchmark graphs with different properties from various domains.",

    "summary": "The problem of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning has been widely explored by traditional rule-based systems and more recently by knowledge graph embedding methods. While logical rules can capture deterministic behavior in a KG they are brittle and mining ones that infer facts beyond the known KG is challenging. Probabilistic embedding methods are effective in capturing global soft statistical tendencies and reasoning with them is computationally efficient. While embedding representations learned from rich training data are expressive, incompleteness and sparsity in real-world KGs can impact their effectiveness. We aim to leverage the complementary properties of both methods to develop a hybrid model that learns both high-quality rules and embeddings simultaneously. Our method uses a cross feedback paradigm wherein, an embedding model is used to guide the search of a rule mining system to mine rules and infer new facts. These new facts are sampled and further used to refine the embedding model. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method over other competitive standalone and hybrid baselines. We also show its efficacy in a sparse KG setting and finally explore the connection with negative sampling.",

In this work, we propose a message passing based graph encoder - StarE capable of modeling such hyper-relational KGs. Unlike existing approaches, StarE can encode an arbitrary number of additional information (qualifiers) along with the main triple while keeping the semantic roles of qualifiers and triples intact. We also demonstrate that existing benchmarks for evaluating link prediction (LP) performance on hyper-relational KGs suffer from fundamental flaws and thus develop a new Wikidata-based dataset - WD50K. Our experiments demonstrate that StarE based LP model outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. We also confirm that leveraging qualifiers is vital for link prediction with gains up to 25 MRR points compared to triple-based representations.",

It employs regression functions for predicting one node attribute from another depending on the relationship between the nodes and the type of the attributes.

    "summary": "Most existing knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness. Embedding knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces has recently attracted increasing interest in knowledge base completion. However, in most existing embedding methods, only fact triplets are utilized, and logical rules have not been thoroughly studied for the knowledge base completion task. To overcome the problem, we propose an association rules enhanced knowledge graph attention network (AR-KGAT). The AR-KGAT captures both entity and relation features for high-order neighborhoods of any given entity in an end-to-end manner under the graph attention network framework. The major component of AR-KGAT is an encoder of an effective neighborhood aggregator, which addresses the problems by aggregating neighbors with both association-rules-based and graph-based attention weights. Additionally, the proposed model also encapsulates the representations from multi-hop neighbors of nodes to refine their embeddings. The decoder enables AR-KGAT to be translational between entities and relations while keeping the superior link prediction performance. A logic-like inference pattern is utilized as constraints for knowledge graph embedding. Then, the global loss is minimized over both atomic and complex formulas to achieve the embedding task. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible with triplets and rules, which are certainly more predictive for knowledge acquisition and inference. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: WN18RR and FB15k-237, for two knowledge graph completion tasks: the link prediction and triplet classification to evaluate the proposed AR-KGAT model. The results show that the proposed AR-KGAT model achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

We advocate a holistic understanding of KGs and we propose in this work a unified Generalized Relation Learning framework GRL to address the above two problems, which can be plugged into existing link prediction models. GRL conducts a generalized relation learning, which is aware of semantic correlations between relations that serve as a bridge to connect semantically similar relations. After training with GRL, the closeness of semantically similar relations in vector space and the discrimination of dissimilar relations are improved. We perform comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks to demonstrate the superior capability of GRL in the link prediction task. In particular, GRL is found to enhance the existing link prediction models making them insensitive to unbalanced relation distributions and capable of learning unseen relations.",

Link prediction is often used as a proxy to evaluate the quality of these embeddings. Given that the creation of benchmarks for link prediction is a time-consuming endeavor, most work on the subject matter uses only a few benchmarks. As benchmarks are crucial for the fair comparison of algorithms, ensuring their quality is tantamount to providing a solid ground for developing better solutions to link prediction and ipso facto embedding knowledge graphs. First studies of benchmarks pointed to limitations pertaining to information leaking from the development to the test fragments of some benchmark datasets. We spotted a further common limitation of three of the benchmarks commonly used for evaluating link prediction approaches: out-of-vocabulary entities in the test and validation sets. We provide an implementation of an approach for spotting and removing such entities and provide corrected versions of the datasets WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10. Our experiments on the corrected versions of WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10 suggest that the measured performance of state-of-the-art approaches is altered significantly with p-values <1%, <1.4%, and <1%, respectively. Overall, state-of-the-art approaches gain on average absolute $3.29 \\pm 0.24\\%$ in all metrics on WN18RR. This means that some of the conclusions achieved in previous works might need to be revisited.
