    "summary": "In adversarial training, a set of models learn together by pursuing competing goals, usually defined on single data instances. However, in relational learning and other non-i.i.d domains, goals can also be defined over sets of instances. For example, a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be consistent with the transitivity property: if is-a(x_1, x_2) and is-a(x_2, x_3) hold, is-a(x_1, x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for deriving an inconsistency loss, measuring the degree to which the model violates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The training objective is defined as a minimax problem, where an adversary finds the most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss, and the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the inconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method that can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any neural link predictor, with complexity independent of the domain size. We show that for several link prediction models, the optimisation problem faced by the adversary has efficient closed-form solutions. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks indicate that given suitable prior knowledge, our method can significantly improve neural link predictors on all relevant metrics.",

    "summary": "Graph representations of large knowledge bases may comprise billions of edges. Usually built upon human-generated ontologies, several knowledge bases do not feature declared ontological rules and are far from being complete. Current rule mining approaches rely on schemata or store the graph in-memory, which can be unfeasible for large graphs. In this paper, we introduce HornConcerto, an algorithm to discover Horn clauses in large graphs without the need of a schema. Using a standard fact-based confidence score, we can mine close Horn rules having an arbitrary body size. We show that our method can outperform existing approaches in terms of runtime and memory consumption and mine high-quality rules for the link prediction task, achieving state-of-the-art results on a widely-used benchmark. Moreover, we find that rules alone can perform inference significantly faster than embedding-based methods and achieve accuracies on link prediction comparable to resource-demanding approaches such as Markov Logic Networks.",

Despite its effectiveness in a benign environment, KGE' robustness to adversarial attacks is not well-studied. Existing attack methods on graph data cannot be directly applied to attack the embeddings of knowledge graph due to its heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of data poisoning attack strategies, which can effectively manipulate the plausibility of arbitrary targeted facts in a knowledge graph by adding or deleting facts on the graph.

However, existing graph embedding techniques are unable to cope with fairness constraints, e.g., ensuring that the learned representations do not correlate with certain attributes, such as age or gender. Here, we introduce an adversarial framework to enforce fairness constraints on graph embeddings. Our approach is compositional---meaning that it can flexibly accommodate different combinations of fairness constraints during inference. For instance, in the context of social recommendations, our framework would allow one user to request that their recommendations are invariant to both their age and gender, while also allowing another user to request invariance to just their age.

The two types of graphs can contain distinct and complementary information for the same entities/nodes. However, previous works focus either on knowledge graph embedding or behavior graph embedding while few works consider both in a unified way. Here we present BEM , a Bayesian framework that incorporates the information from knowledge graphs and behavior graphs. To be more specific, BEM takes as prior the pre-trained embeddings from the knowledge graph, and integrates them with the pre-trained embeddings from the behavior graphs via a Bayesian generative model. BEM is able to mutually refine the embeddings from both sides while preserving their own topological structures. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct a range of experiments on three benchmark datasets: node classification, link prediction, triplet classification on two small datasets related to Freebase, and item recommendation on a large-scale e-commerce dataset.",

At the core of the construction is to deduce the structure of the target query and determine the vertices/edges which constitute the query.

In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel framework standing on recent knowledge graph embedding techniques. Our framework first encodes the underlying knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embedding space by leveraging generalized local knowledge graphs. Given a natural language question, the learned embedding representations of the knowledge graph are utilized to compute the query structure and assemble vertices/edges into the target query.

    "summary": "Many practical graph problems, such as knowledge graph construction and drug-drug interaction prediction, require to handle multi-relational graphs. However, handling real-world multi-relational graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, as new entities (nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction task but also between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for knowledge graph completion and drug-drug interaction prediction. The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have received increasing attention in recent machine learning. How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly optimizing the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the GEneralized Multi-relational Graph Convolutional Networks (GEM-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge-base embedding methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that GEM-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of GEM-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification.",

    "summary": "Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of entities and relationships, has attracted considerable research efforts recently. However, most knowledge graph embedding methods focus on the structural relationships in fixed triples while ignoring the temporal information. Currently, existing time-aware graph embedding methods only focus on the factual plausibility, while ignoring the temporal smoothness which models the interactions between a fact and its contexts, and thus can capture fine-granularity temporal relationships. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a Robustly Time-aware Graph Embedding (RTGE) method by incorporating temporal smoothness. Two major innovations of our paper are presented here. At first, RTGE integrates a measure of temporal smoothness in the learning process of the time-aware graph embedding. Via the proposed additional smoothing factor, RTGE can preserve both structural information and evolutionary patterns of a given graph. Secondly, RTGE provides a general task-oriented negative sampling strategy associated with temporally-aware information, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed algorithm and plays an essential role in obtaining superior performance in various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark tasks show that RTGE can increase performance in entity/relationship/temporal scoping prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "Representation learning methods for heterogeneous networks produce a low-dimensional vector embedding for each node that is typically fixed for all tasks involving the node. Many of the existing methods focus on obtaining a static vector representation for a node in a way that is agnostic to the downstream application where it is being used. In practice, however, downstream tasks such as link prediction require specific contextual information that can be extracted from the subgraphs related to the nodes provided as input to the task. To tackle this challenge, we develop SLiCE, a framework bridging static representation learning methods using global information from the entire graph with localized attention driven mechanisms to learn contextual node representations. We first pre-train our model in a self-supervised manner by introducing higher-order semantic associations and masking nodes, and then fine-tune our model for a specific link prediction task. Instead of training node representations by aggregating information from all semantic neighbors connected via metapaths, we automatically learn the composition of different metapaths that characterize the context for a specific task without the need for any pre-defined metapaths. SLiCE significantly outperforms both static and contextual embedding learning methods on several publicly available benchmark network datasets. We also interpret the semantic association matrix and provide its utility and relevance in making successful link predictions between heterogeneous nodes in the network.",

On the other hand, the success of neural networks for classification tasks in various domains leads researchers to study them in graphs. When a neural network can operate directly on the graph, then it is termed as the graph neural network (GNN). GNN is able to learn hidden features from graphs which can be used for link prediction task in graphs. Link predictions based on GNNs have gained much attention of researchers due to their convincing high performance in many real-world graphs. This appraisal paper studies some similarity and GNN-based link prediction approaches in the domain of homogeneous graphs that consists of a single type of (attributed) nodes and single type of pairwise links.

While logical rules can capture deterministic behavior in a KG they are brittle and mining ones that infer facts beyond the known KG is challenging. Probabilistic embedding methods are effective in capturing global soft statistical tendencies and reasoning with them is computationally efficient. While embedding representations learned from rich training data are expressive, incompleteness and sparsity in real-world KGs can impact their effectiveness. We aim to leverage the complementary properties of both methods to develop a hybrid model that learns both high-quality rules and embeddings simultaneously. Our method uses a cross feedback paradigm wherein, an embedding model is used to guide the search of a rule mining system to mine rules and infer new facts. These new facts are sampled and further used to refine the embedding model. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method over other competitive standalone and hybrid baselines. We also show its efficacy in a sparse KG setting and finally explore the connection with negative sampling.",

Embedding knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces has recently attracted increasing interest in knowledge base completion. However, in most existing embedding methods, only fact triplets are utilized, and logical rules have not been thoroughly studied for the knowledge base completion task. To overcome the problem, we propose an association rules enhanced knowledge graph attention network (AR-KGAT). The AR-KGAT captures both entity and relation features for high-order neighborhoods of any given entity in an end-to-end manner under the graph attention network framework. The major component of AR-KGAT is an encoder of an effective neighborhood aggregator, which addresses the problems by aggregating neighbors with both association-rules-based and graph-based attention weights. Additionally, the proposed model also encapsulates the representations from multi-hop neighbors of nodes to refine their embeddings. The decoder enables AR-KGAT to be translational between entities and relations while keeping the superior link prediction performance. A logic-like inference pattern is utilized as constraints for knowledge graph embedding. Then, the global loss is minimized over both atomic and complex formulas to achieve the embedding task. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible with triplets and rules, which are certainly more predictive for knowledge acquisition and inference. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: WN18RR and FB15k-237, for two knowledge graph completion tasks: the link prediction and triplet classification to evaluate the proposed AR-KGAT model.

GRL conducts a generalized relation learning, which is aware of semantic correlations between relations that serve as a bridge to connect semantically similar relations. After training with GRL, the closeness of semantically similar relations in vector space and the discrimination of dissimilar relations are improved. We perform comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks to demonstrate the superior capability of GRL in the link prediction task. In particular, GRL is found to enhance the existing link prediction models making them insensitive to unbalanced relation distributions and capable of learning unseen relations.",

    "summary": "Embedding entities and relations of a knowledge graph in a low-dimensional space has shown impressive performance in predicting missing links between entities. Although progresses have been achieved, existing methods are heuristically motivated and theoretical understanding of such embeddings is comparatively underdeveloped. This paper extends the random walk model (Arora et al., 2016a) of word embeddings to Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to derive a scoring function that evaluates the strength of a relation R between two entities h (head) and t (tail). Moreover, we show that marginal loss minimisation, a popular objective used in much prior work in KGE, follows naturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities estimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a learning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a given knowledge graph. Using the derived objective, accurate KGEs are learnt from FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in support of the theory.",

    "summary": "Biomedical knowledge graphs permit an integrative computational approach to reasoning about biological systems. The nature of biological data leads to a graph structure that differs from those typically encountered in benchmarking datasets. To understand the implications this may have on the performance of reasoning algorithms, we conduct an empirical study based on the real-world task of drug repurposing. We formulate this task as a link prediction problem where both compounds and diseases correspond to entities in a knowledge graph. To overcome apparent weaknesses of existing algorithms, we propose a new method, PoLo, that combines policy-guided walks based on reinforcement learning with logical rules. These rules are integrated into the algorithm by using a novel reward function. We apply our method to Hetionet, which integrates biomedical information from 29 prominent bioinformatics databases. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for link prediction while providing interpretability.",

    "summary": "Despite the importance and abundance of temporal knowledge graphs, most of the current research has been focused on reasoning on static graphs. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of inference over temporal knowledge graphs. In particular, the task of temporal link prediction. In general, this is a difficult task due to data non-stationarity, data heterogeneity, and its complex temporal dependencies. We propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph. Experimentally, we show that ChronoR is able to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets for temporal knowledge graph link prediction.",
